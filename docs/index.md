# Introduction

A [Nassi-Shneiderman diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nassi%E2%80%93Shneiderman_diagram), also known as a structogram, is a graphical representation outlining the sequential steps and control flows of a computer program, offering a visual guide for programmers.

The project tranforms a piece of code into such a diagram which can exported as an image or as a shareable link.
The live editor is available on [https://eurydia.github.io/project-nassi-shneiderman-diagram-builder-online/](https://eurydia.github.io/project-nassi-shneiderman-diagram-builder-online/).
