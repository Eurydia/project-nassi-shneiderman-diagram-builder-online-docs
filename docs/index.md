# Introduction

The NSD builder lets you create [Nassi-Shneiderman diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nassi%E2%80%93Shneiderman_diagram) programmatically from a piece of code, and export it to an image or as a URL that can be shared with others.

It is JavaScript-based diagramming tool similar to [MermaidJs](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/) and [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/), but if I really have to compare it to something, I would say that it is similar to one of those [turtle graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_graphics) tools where you enter instructions and the turtle draws the image.

The builder uses a special programming language similar to the C programming language, so if you are familiar with C, you will feel right at home.

The builder is online and can be found at [https://eurydia.github.io/project-nassi-shneiderman-diagram-builder-online/](https://eurydia.github.io/project-nassi-shneiderman-diagram-builder-online/).
