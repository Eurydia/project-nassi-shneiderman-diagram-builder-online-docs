# Introduction

The project is a diagramming tool, similar to [MermaidJS](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/).
It converts a piece of code into a [Nassi-Shneiderman diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nassi%E2%80%93Shneiderman_diagram), which can exported as an image or as a unique link.

The live editor is available on [https://eurydia.github.io/project-nassi-shneiderman-diagram-builder-online/](https://eurydia.github.io/project-nassi-shneiderman-diagram-builder-online/).
