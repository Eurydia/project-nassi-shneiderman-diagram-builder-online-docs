# Introduction

The project is a diagramming tool, similar to [MermaidJs](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/).
It converts a piece of code into a [Nassi-Shneiderman diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nassi%E2%80%93Shneiderman_diagram), which can exported as an image or as a unique URL.

The working version has been deployed at [https://eurydia.github.io/project-nassi-shneiderman-diagram-builder-online/](https://eurydia.github.io/project-nassi-shneiderman-diagram-builder-online/) so do give it a look if you are interested.

## Syntax

The project uses a special [pseudocode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudocode), which I have constructed from scratch for this tool.
The syantax draws heavy inspiration from the syntax of the C programming language, and users are encouraged to visit the [Syntax](./02-syntax.md) section for more information.
