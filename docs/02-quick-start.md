# Quick start

## 1. Getting started

To embark on your [Nassiâ€“Shneiderman diagramming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nassi%E2%80%93Shneiderman_diagram) journey, head over to the live editor at [https://eurydia.github.io/project-nassi-shneiderman-diagram-builder-online/](https://eurydia.github.io/project-nassi-shneiderman-diagram-builder-online/).

## 2. Interface overview

The editor presents two fundamental components:

- **Code Editor**: This is where the magic happens. A piece of code written here will be interpreted and transformed into a diagram.
- **Live Preview**: The resulting diagrams are displayed here in real-time.

## 3. Hello World

For those using smaller screens like smartphones or tablets, the code editor might be tucked away initially.
If you find it hidden, simply tap on the "SHOW CODE" button to reveal it.

Now, let's create a simple diagram.

In the code editor, type `Hello World!;`.
The project should generate the corresponding diagram:

<iframe width="100%" style="aspect-ratio: 16/10; border:none;" loading="lazy" src="https://eurydia.github.io/project-nassi-shneiderman-diagram-builder-online/?preview=true&content=Hello+World%21%3B"></iframe>

## 4. Export

Once you are satisfied with the diagram, you can use the export feature to save your diagram in three different file formats: PNG, JPEG, and SVG.

Moreover, sharing is made seamless with the ability to generate a unique link for your diagram.

## 5. Advanced syntax

As you grow more comfortable with the basics, delve into advanced features.
Experiment with different diagram structures; loops, branches, and functions.
The editor adapts to your coding style, offering a dynamic representation of diverse programming constructs.
