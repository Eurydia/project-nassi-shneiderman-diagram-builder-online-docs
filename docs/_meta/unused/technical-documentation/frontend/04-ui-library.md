# UI library

The UI library is built with [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/).

I was tempted to use other icon libraries like [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) or [Feather Icons](https://feathericons.com/), but I decided to stick with [MUI Icon](https://material-ui.com/components/material-icons/) for style consistency.
