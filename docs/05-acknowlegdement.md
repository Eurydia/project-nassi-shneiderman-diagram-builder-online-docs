# Acknowledgement

**Vincze Máté** for his invaluable contribution to the development of the structorizer project.
His enthusiasm and interest in the project served as a constant source of motivation and inspiration throughout its creation.
Without his positive feedback and unwavering support, the project would not have reached its current stage.

**Asel Bekbolot Kyzy** ([aselbekbolotkyzy25@gmail.com](mailto:aselbekbolotkyzy25@gmail.com)) for proofreading the documentation and providing feedback on the project, especially her opinion on the lack of comments.
During the earlier stage of the project, I was rather hesitant to implement new features, but she pointed out that comment is a feature that most people have come to expect, and the project should support it.

**Daniya Safiullina** for proofreading the documentation.
The background and motivation section was rewritten to be more coherent and understandable because her ingenuity.

**Asel Temiralieva** for proofreading the documentation and provide helpful insights and improvements.
There were many aspects of the documentation that was changed, removed, or added.
Namely, the syntax overview section and the example section were much less cohesive and consistent before I asked her for feedback.

**Nandin Munkhbat** for providing feedback on UX/UI design, bug report, and, most importantly, suggestion to add implement syntax for functions and prodcedures.
She suggested that functions and procedures are good ways of labeling and capturing the logic a task. To which, I agreed and implemented support both functions and procedures.
