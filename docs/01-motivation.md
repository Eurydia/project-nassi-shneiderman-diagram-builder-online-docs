# Motivation

The motivation for this project is less about NSD and more bout compiler technology.

Early into the project, I realized that the builder had to generate an AST, and then use the AST to generate the diagram so I figured that this was the perfect opportunity to learn.

As for the builder itself, there were a few criteria that I wanted to fulfil.

- The builder must use a C-style syntax, and the syntax should be forgiving and permissive.
- The builder must have a live preview and the ability to export the diagram as an image or share it as a URL.

Another ulterior motive for this project is to create a tool that would provide an alternative to the NSD editor provided by programm course at ELTE so, in that regard, I want to make sure that the builder has a modern UI.
