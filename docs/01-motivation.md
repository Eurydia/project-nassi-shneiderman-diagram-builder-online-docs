# Motivation

I wanted to develop a diagramming tool which build a [Nassi–Shneiderman diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nassi%E2%80%93Shneiderman_diagram) from a piece of code.

## Syntax

I want to construct a new language for the project, but I think it is more appropriate to say "pseudocode".

This pseudocode has to be permissive and flexible to accommodate for the nature of Nassi–Shneiderman diagrams.
It has to be easy to learn and easy to use.

## Features

There are a few features that I want to make sure the project has.

One of the most important aspect of the project is the ability to export diagrams as images or share them via unique links.

I imagine that working without live preview would make this project rather disturbing for the users.
Auto-saving is alsl needed so users can start working where they left off.

Finally, the user interface has to feel modern, though I feel that this one is a bit on the nose, I want to make sure that I listed it here.
