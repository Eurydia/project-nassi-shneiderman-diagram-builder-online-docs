# Motivation

I wanted to develop a diagramming tool which build a [Nassi–Shneiderman diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nassi%E2%80%93Shneiderman_diagram) from a piece of code.

## Syntax

I want to construct a new language for the project, but I think it is more appropriate to say "pseudocode".

This pseudocode has to be permissive and flexible to accommodate for the nature of Nassi–Shneiderman diagrams.
It has to be easy to learn and easy to use.

## Features

There are a few features that I want to make sure the project has.

First, one of the most important aspect of the project is the ability to export the diagrams as images or share the diagrams via unique links.
Without this feature, I would say that this project is, essentially, pointless.

Secondly, the project should have a live preview of the diagram.
I drew heavy inspiration from [CodePen](https://codepen.io/), [re.plit](https://replit.com/), and [jsfiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/).

Thirdly, I want the project should automatically save the diagram, so users can start working where they left off.

Lastly, the user interface has to feel modern.
