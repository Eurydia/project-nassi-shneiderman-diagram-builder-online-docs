# Overview

This section will discuss, in more details, about the actual implementation of the project.
There are three major parts to the project: the interpreter, the rendere, and the frontend, and each part will be discussed in its own section.

- The interpreter section discusses the implementation of the lexer, parser, and the process of generating an AST from user input.
- The renderer section discusses the implementation of the renderer and the process of generating a diagram from an AST.
- The frontend section discusses about layout and UI design, along with web technologies used in the project.
