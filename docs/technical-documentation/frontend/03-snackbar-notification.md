# Snackbar notification

When copying a shareable link or exporting a diagram, a snackbar notification will appear to provide feedback to the user.
This is handled by [Notistack](https://iamhosseindhv.com/notistack).

There is no practical reason why I chose Notistack over other libraries, apart from the fact that it is built on top of Material UI, so it is very easy to integrate it with Material UI.
