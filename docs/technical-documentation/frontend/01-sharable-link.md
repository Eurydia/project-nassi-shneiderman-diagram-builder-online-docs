# Sharable link

One of the main features of the application is the ability to share a diagram with other users via a sharable link.

The link is generated by setting a query parameter in the URL to the content of the code editor.

The content of the query parameter is read into the code editor when the application is loaded.

Here is a snippet for generating the sharable link:

```ts
const url = new URL(window.location.href);
url.searchParams.set("preview", "true");
url.searchParams.set("content", editorContent);
navigator.clipboard.writeText(url.href);
enqueueSnackbar("Copied link to clipboard", {
	variant: "info",
});
```
